Here I am, in the night  
Lying on my bed wondering  
Looking at a screen, with no response  
Waiting for one, and pondering  

As to where did she go all of a sudden  
Into the dark night  
The one who stays awake the longest  
Has she slept downright?  

But there's stuff to do, important tomorrow  
That needs sleep and rest  
Maybe she actually needed more  
Than she did attest  

But before you go to sleep this night,  
Or when you wake up in the morn  
Always remember  
Never go silent into the dark night  
Fight, fight, against the dying light.
