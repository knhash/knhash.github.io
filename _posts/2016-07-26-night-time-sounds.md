Oftentimes I lay awake,  
Trying to sleep but it stays away  
The white noise that induce sleep  
Seem so loud, they keep me awake  

The gentle ticking of the clock  
Grows aloud as the time crawls  
A beating drum in the inner ear  
A hammering second hand of the clock  

The sound of moving air and blades  
The fan, during the day barely registers  
Now spewing more noise than wind  
At night, those deafening blades  

Louder still are the rains  
The splattering on the roads outside  
The rooftop waters falling even  
After the actual stopping of the rains  

But the sound that never goes off  
The one present in your mind  
A high pitch humming, a constant tone  
Is the one to which you finally nod off
