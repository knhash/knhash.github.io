The scenario is this:

> You are going on a vacation with your friends and there are going to be multiple occasions where decisions would need to be made. 

These decisions could, of course, be held with a random number generator. This would give a fair and equal opportunity to all. But this does not take the person's _personal preference_ into account. I don't really care if I get shotgun on the 6 hour drive, but I really want a window seat. Someone else really prefers having the dorm bed farthest from the toilet. And so on. 

The decision makers here are not changing, which is key. They are rational and will abide by the algorithm if it guarantees two things - 

* is fair, over the course of the whole vacation
* accounts for the preference of the person in some form

A more generic example would be the passing of bills in a Parliament. 

In this text I want to explore a new consensus protocol and I invite you to break it down. But gently please. This is, above all, a fun thought experiment.

_Or maybe this is not something new and I have woefully bad research skills_

Let us formally define the problem statement.
