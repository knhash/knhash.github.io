## Advertisements
We hate them. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
  
What if you had a personal ad block server, with which you could... 
- Protect your entire network fro malware ridden sites
- Block ads in apps and websites, on all your devices, no extra configuration 
- Have faster network performance
- Monitor and control your network with a neat web interface 
- (Or) Just set and forget it

A custom built a RaspberryPi server, preloaded it with PiHole and installed over your
