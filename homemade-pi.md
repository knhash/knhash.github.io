#### for a cleaner, better internet

## Advertisements

We hate them. _It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere._

What if you had a personal ad block server, with which you could...

- Protect your entire network from malware ridden sites
- Block ads in apps and websites, on all your devices, no extra configuration
- Have faster network performance
- Monitor and control your network with a neat web interface
- (Or) Just set and forget it

## The Homemade Pi

Once installed it is yours 100%, _you own it_.

## Who, what, why?

I strongly believe advertisements come at high cost: one of our attention. They occupy valuable screen real estate, distract us with re-directs, entice us with hyper personalized recommendations. The personalization algorithms know what you will and will not buy, they analyze the ever-so-subtle reactions to your every move on the internet to present ads that are _optimized_ to steal your attention. 

They are ubiquitous because they work as a business model and until we find a more sustainable one they are going to stay with us for a long time to come. I do not have a solution yet, but I find the current state unacceptable. I Pi-Hole set up at my home so my family do not have to worry about malware ridden, pop-up filled, ad infested websites and apps. So they can browse the internet with no additional setup necessary, the ads being blocked at the router. 

The very neat dashboard and granular network level controls are a huge [nerd snipe](https://xkcd.com/356).

The target audience here is _YOU_, the *family-tech-person*. Someone who understands the benefits yet does not have the patience to source and set this up over a weekend. But once setup, you can use the Pi for anything you want. The first step is the hardest, but once you have crossed that barrier, this could be your introduction to the world of self-hosted software even. The possibilities...

A very, _very_, niche audience, yes. And hence the interest check. It also ties in with another idea I am noodling around with, but more on that some other time.

So, are you interested?
