## Advertisements

We hate them. _It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere._

What if you had a personal ad block server, with which you could...

- Protect your entire network fro malware ridden sites
- Block ads in apps and websites, on all your devices, no extra configuration
- Have faster network performance
- Monitor and control your network with a neat web interface
- (Or) Just set and forget it
