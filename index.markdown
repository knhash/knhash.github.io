My name is **Shashank** and I solve problems.

<!-- <img src="images/about.jpg" alt="knhash" class="nav-image"/> -->

As a Data Scientist at [Glance](https://glance.com) I work on large scale intelligence systems, concentrating on ML Engineering and MLOps. Current focus areas include Recommender Systems in an online learning environment and NLP.

Previously, I was at [Bright](https://www.brightmoney.co), automating FinTech decisions leveraging AI. We solved for reducing credit card debt and I was involved in building the first Automated Debt Manager.

> I am building [\[Ghost Game\]](https://ghostgame.io) which is a multiplayer word game where the goal is to _not_ complete the word.

I play [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com); if you do too, care to multi-play?

Some toys and general stupidity:


|[\[theThing\]]({{ site.other_links.theThing }} "theThing")|scan your face to check if you have "the thing"|
|[\[DiffAKI\]]({{ site.other_links.DiffAKI }} "DiffAKI")|[a pictionary game, with Stable Diffusion](https://knhash.in/blog/i-also-want-to-do-something-with-stable-diffusion "[diffAKI]")|
|[\[Wazir\]]({{ site.other_links.Wazir }} "Wazir")|the general purpose image and text combinator|

I make round, fluffy Chappatis and frothy, filter Coffee.
