My name is **Shashank** and I solve problems.

<!-- <img src="images/about.jpg" alt="knhash" class="nav-image"/> -->

I work on large scale intelligence systems, concentrating on ML Engineering and MLOps. Current focus area is Recommender Systems in an online learning environment.

I play [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com); it is very fun, we should play it together. Please join me.

#### I am currently working on a [podcast idea]({{ site.special_links.Sessions }} "Shank's Sunday Sessions"), help me make it successful!

I make round, fluffy Chappatis and frothy, filter Coffee. I am a staunch believer of "cooking recipes are more like guidelines anyway". Read it once and then let [the rat in your head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)) lead you. It is very hard to make something inedible :)

Send me an [e-mail](mailto:mail@knhash.in) to have a conversation.
