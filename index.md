Hello.

My name is **Shashank** and I solve problems.

<!-- <img src="images/about.jpg" alt="knhash" class="nav-image"/> -->

As a Data Scientist at [Glance](https://glance.com) I work on large scale intelligence systems, concentrating on ML Engineering and MLOps. Current focus areas include Recommender Systems in an online learning environment and NLP.

> I am building [\[Ghost Game\]](https://ghostgame.io) which is a multiplayer word game where the goal is to _not_ complete the word.

I play [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com); if you do too, care to multi-play?

Check out some fun links on the top nav bar. They are enclosed in `[square brackets like so]`. Most recently I created [\[diffAKI\]](https://knhash.in/blog/i-also-want-to-do-something-with-stable-diffusion "[diffAKI]").

Previously, I was at [Bright](https://www.brightmoney.co), automating FinTech decisions leveraging AI. We solved for reducing credit card debt and I was involved in building the first Automated Debt Manager.

I make round, fluffy Chappatis and frothy, filter Coffee.

[\[E-mail me\]](mailto:mail@knhash.in). Seriously, I love getting e-mails from people. We can chat about stuff.
