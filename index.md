My name is Shashank and I am primarily a Problem Solver. 

As a Data Scientist at [Glance](https://glance.com) I work on large scale intelligence systems. With a concentration in ML Engineering and MLOps, I work towards building real-time and scalable infrastructure. Current focus areas include NLP and Recommender Systems in an online learning environment.

Previously, I was at [Bright](https://www.brightmoney.co), automating FinTech decisions leveraging AI. We solved for reducing credit card debt and I was involved in building the first Automated Debt Manager.

I solve problems good, nice results. So [hit me up](mailto:mail@knhash.in), I am very good. 

...or perhaps you are simply interested in my [resume]({{ site.resume }})?
